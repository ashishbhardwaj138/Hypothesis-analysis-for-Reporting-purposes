    "Verticals/Components of D&I:- \n",
    "1. Gender and Age Diversity\n",
    "    This vertical examines how gender and age diversity within the team or organization impacts KPI achievement. These hypotheses highlight the importance of balancing representation and leveraging diverse age groups to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "    Hypothesis 1: Female agents perform as well as male agents.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 2: Age diversity impacts KPI achievement.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 3: Gender balance within teams correlates with better KPI scores.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 11: Agents working in diverse teams (in terms of gender, age, or other factors) perform better than those in homogeneous teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Work-Life Balance and Flexibility\n",
    "    This vertical addresses the effects of flexible work arrangements (remote work, flexible hours) on employee performance. It also touches on how the company accommodates various work schedules and the impact on inclusivity and KPI outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "    Hypothesis 4: Younger employees perform better when given flexible work arrangements.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 7: Agents working remotely achieve better KPI scores.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 12: Agents with more flexible work schedules (e.g., working from home) achieve better KPI scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Training and Development\n",
    "    This vertical is focused on how providing adequate training and development opportunities impacts agent performance. It evaluates whether investment in learning leads to improved KPIs and increased diversity in skill sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "    Hypothesis 5: Younger agents receive more training and achieve better KPI scores.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 13: Agents with more training hours perform better on KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Team and Manager Inclusivity\n",
    "    This vertical evaluates the role of inclusivity within teams and management. It explores whether diverse leadership styles, inclusive managers, and team skill diversity lead to improved agent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "    Hypothesis 6: Agents with inclusive managers perform better.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 10: Larger teams perform better under managers with more inclusive leadership.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 14: Teams with more diverse skill sets perform better.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 16: Agents with more inclusive managers (e.g., managers who promote diversity and inclusion) perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Minority Group Representation\n",
    "    This vertical focuses on the performance of minority groups within the organization. It aims to assess whether underrepresented groups perform as well as the majority, ensuring equity in opportunities and performance evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "    Hypothesis 8: Female agents are assigned tougher teams.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 9: Minority agents perform as well as majority agents.\n",
    "    Hypothesis 15: Agents from underrepresented groups (e.g., minorities) perform as well as agents from majority groups.\n"
